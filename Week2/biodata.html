                    questions about themselves, there are elements of 
                    both biography and autobiography. The basis of 
                    biodata's predictive abilities is the axiom that past 
                    behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour.
                    Biographical information is not expected to predict 
                    all future behaviours but it is useful in personal 
                    selection in that it can give an indication of 
                    probable future behaviours based on an individual's 
                    prior learning history.[4] Bi</td>
